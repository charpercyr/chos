1- Go to x64
    - First 4GB identity mapped with 1GB pages

2- Initialize simple serial

3- Enable timer
    - Calculate timer frequency
    - Used for delays

4- Load and map kernel from multiboot2
    - PIC x64 kernel
    - Map to higher half

5- Start other processors
    - All x64 with the same page table

6- Jump to kernel, from all processors
    - rsi = multiboot2 structure
    - rdx = Physical <-> Virtual memory map
    - rcx = initrd
    - Page table
        - First 0-4GB mapped
        - Kernel mapped
